<h1 align="center">RS232 Recorder <br> Record and analyze data from a serial port</h1>
<div align="center">Serial Port Monitor is an advanced software solution for monitoring and recording COM port data. With this efficient serial data recorder, users get full control over what data is sent and received by their system serial ports. Serial Port Monitor is the optimal solution for those who are developing, optimizing, or testing serial drivers, hardware, applications, etc. This monitoring solution lets you easily spot serial port issues arising in the system and solve them at once.
 
Convenient filtering and search options provided by the solution will help users find valuable information in a matter of seconds. Plus, the software <a href="https://www.eltima.com/products/rs232-data-logger/">Serial data recorder</a> offers built-in terminal and useful data exporting capabilities. Serial Port Monitor is a friendly software tool used without any complex additional hardware.

<h2>Serial Data Recorder Software provides users with a unique feature set:</h2>
<li><b>Analysis of COM port communications</b><br>
It’s no problem if the required COM port is already opened by another app, the software will easily access the port and start monitoring it. Even better, all captured data will be available in software interface in several views. This way, you’ll be able to see synchronized highlighting of similar IRPs in different formats which is particularly helpful for data analysis and comparing.
With software powerful features, you can receive information on the performance of your serial applications in real time, and immediately detect where problems occur. More than that, software RS232 recorder makes it possible to capture serial port data to a file, and save recorded information to the clipboard. Complete details and parameters of all input/output control codes (IOCTLs) can also be intercepted and saved.</li>
<li><b>Recording multiple ports at a time</b><br>
Serial Port Monitor provides a way to sniff several COM interfaces and record data transmitted through them within one session. That means you are able to collect all the necessary information about simultaneous interaction of your applications with several COM ports or devices. With that, the software will use first in, first out method to save all captured data to a single log.</li>
<li><b>Different viewing options</b><br>
Serial data recorder software allows visualizing COM port communications in real time and provides four viewing modes to see captured data. There are table, line, dump, and terminal views. Each data visualizer represents one format of data display. For instance, binary and ASCII data, as well as port settings are available in dump mode. This visualization approach enables the software users either to see and compare serial data in four monitoring views at once or choose one mode best suited to their needs.</li>
<li><b>Emulation of data exchange</b><br>
Another aspect that sets Serial Port Monitor apart from other monitoring solutions is support for terminal mode. With this useful option, you can simulate sending data from a monitored app to a monitored COM port in string, binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal, mixed data formats. This makes a lot of sense when there’s a need to check the reaction of a particular COM port peripheral or program to some kind of data.</li>
<li><b>Modbus sniffing</b><br>
What makes life easier for many developers is the software capability to catch Modbus data. Both Modbus RTU and Modbus ASCII protocols are supported by COM Port Data Recorder.</li>
<li><b>Session playback</b><br>
To obtain the most accurate monitoring results, you can use a convenient session playback feature. This option lets repeat sending of received data to the same port again. Best of all, the differences between sessions can be shown automatically.</li>
